## Development
To install dependencies, after installing `ruby`, install bundle with `gem install bundler` and then
use `bundle install` to install dependencies.

Now you can start editing files in `source` directory. Launch a server with `make serve` to view the
resulting HTML in your browser.

To build the site run `make build`. This will generate site's static files in `build` folder.
